# Custom Styles

Custom style settings allow you to control how your Glean project looks and feels.

## Color Palettes

Color palettes set the default color for a chart and the colors for [color breakouts](/docs/visualizing-data/breakout)

Breakout colors are set with the `Secondary colors`. At least two secondary colors are required for a color palette. You can opt to either cycle and repeat though your colors or interpolate new colors when there are more breakouts than colors you have defined.

Any color palette you define can be set as your project default.
