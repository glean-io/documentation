# Create Retention Curves

[Retention curves](https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/retention) allow you to
see how many users are still active at a given point in time and compare
different cohorts of users to see how well your product retains engagement. This
article doesn't dedicate too much time to how to analyze retention curves since
there is plenty of content dedicated to this out there.

The approach is very similar to the general approach to data modeling: you'll
prepare a set of metrics that define the percent of users that are still active
in a month and add attributes that help you understand the variation. See the
article
[Data Modeling Best Practices](/docs/data-modeling/data-modeling-best-practices)

For retention curves, it's oftentimes useful to add experiments as attributes:
did you try something in the product to retain users more effectively? Maybe a
new onboarding flow, a new user flow?

For this walk-through, we're going to look at the user engagement on the tech
news aggregation website Hacker News. The dataset is available on BigQuery's
public datasets and is kept up to date.

## Prepare curves in your data warehouse

As with all tools you build in Glean, retention curves will be as powerful as
the data model you produce for them. For large user tables, it probably makes
sense to prepare this data in your data warehouse, but it's also possible to
calculate retention curves on the fly using a SQL-based data model. See
[Add Data Model](/docs/data-modeling/add-data-model)

To prepare our curves, we are going to track whether a user is active or not in
any given month. So that all of our users are being compared fairly, we'll also
track the number of months since a user signed up - this will be the x-axis of
our retention curve.

You should be targeting a data model that looks something like the following
table:

| userid          | user signup month | activity month    | months since signup | is_active |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- | --------- |
| carlos@glean    | August 1, 2020    | August 1, 2020    | 0                   | 1         |
| carlos@glean    | August 1, 2020    | September 1, 2020 | 1                   | 1         |
| carlos@glean    | August 1, 2020    | October 1, 2020   | 2                   | 0         |
| carlos@glean    | August 1, 2020    | November 1, 2020  | 3                   | 0         |
| nathaniel@glean | July 1, 2020      | July 1, 2020      | 0                   | 1         |

| nathaniel@glean | July 1, 2020      | September 1, 2020 | 2                   | 1         |
| nathaniel@glean | July 1, 2020      | October 1, 2020   | 3                   | 1         |
| nathaniel@glean | July 1, 2020      | November 1, 2020  | 4                   | 1         |

For the Hacker News dataset the query looks something like this (using BigQuery
syntax):

```sql
with all_months as (
  select
    distinct timestamp_trunc(timestamp, month) as month
  from `bigquery-public-data.hacker_news.full`
),
active_months as (
  select
    distinct `by` as userid
    , timestamp_trunc(timestamp, month) as month
  from`bigquery-public-data.hacker_news.full`
),
users as (
  select
    `by` as userid
    , min(timestamp_trunc(timestamp, month)) as first_month
    , max(timestamp_trunc(timestamp, month)) as last_month
  from `bigquery-public-data.hacker_news.full`
  group BY userid
)
select
  u.userid
  , m.month
  , first_month as cohort_month
  , cast(first_month as string) as cohort_month_str
  , date_diff(DATE(m.month), DATE(u.first_month), MONTH) as month_number
-- could add cohort
--  , experiment_cohort as experiment
  , if(m.month <= u.last_month, 1.0, 0.0) as unbounded_active
  , if(a.month IS NOT NULL, 1.0, 0.0) as active
from users as u
  cross join all_months as m
  left join active_months as a
    on a.userid = u.userid and a.month = m.month
  where m.month >= u.first_month
;
```

A few notes on the resulting columns:

- **userid** - self-explanatory, this is string representing our user
- **month** - this is a date representation of the month in which an activity
  happens
- **cohort_month** - this is the month a user joined the site
- **cohort_month_str** - this is a bit of a workaround: you will cast your
  cohort month to a string so you can use it as an attribute and cut by it in
  Glean
- **month_number** - this is the number of months since a user joined the
  platform, this will be the x axis of our curve
- **experiment** - this is a randomly assigned experiment for each user. Note
  that in this column and for this model, each user can only be assigned to a
  single experimental cohort.
- **active** - either 1 or 0 for each user in a month. A value of 1 means the
  user was active in that month and zero means inactive.
- **unbounded_active** - either 1 or 0 for each user in a month. A value of 1
  means that a user was either active in that month or in any month after. This
  will help us answer the question "of users in this month, what percent of
  users abandoned us and have not returned since"

## Create the model in Glean

1. From the data exploration page, click
   [Add Data Model](/docs/data-modeling/add-data-model)
2. Either select your prepared retention table from your data warehouse or click
   `SQL Query` and enter a SQL query similar to the one above as the basis for
   your model. Click `Create Model`
3. Set up your data model in Glean:

   - Make sure that `month` is selected as your primary date, by selecting the
     gear next to it.
   - Add `cohort_month_str`, `month_number` as attributes along with any
     experimental cohort attributes you prepared in your data.
   - Add two columns as metrics:

     - **Unbounded Active Retention** - is defined as the `average` of column
       `unbounded_active`
     - **Active Retention** - is defined as the `average` of column `active`
     - **Active Users (Optional)** - if you want to create a retention pivot,
       you should also add a metric for unique active users in a month:

     ```sql
     COUNT(DISTINCT IF(active = 1, userid, null))
     ```

4. Click `Publish`

/>

1. Change the chart type to a `line`
2. Select `month_number` as the x-axis variable
3. Select `Unbounded Active Retention` as your metric
4. Select some `cohort_month_str` as breakouts to see how different cohort
   months retain users in your product. Alternatively, you can filter for a
   specific cohort month and breakout by an experimental variable

<Callout type="info">
  Note that not breaking out (or filtering) by `cohort_month_str` has some
  implications for your analysis. This is because not every cohort month has an
  equal number of future months. To correct for this, it's possible to use a
  Kaplan-Meier estimator which will be left as a separate exercise.

1. Make sure you add the Active Users metric specified above.
2. Select a `pivot table` as your visualization type from the chart dropdown on
   the top left.
3. Select `cohort` as your rows.
4. Select `month_number` as your columns.
5. Click into the `control` tab on the right-hand side and make sure you sort
   rows by `cohort` descending and sort the columns by `month_number` ascending.
6. As the metric, select `Active Users` as the calculation, select
   `Percentage of Row Max` and finally as the Color scale, select
   `Percentage Color Scale`.
