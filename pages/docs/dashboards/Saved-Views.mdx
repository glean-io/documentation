## Configuration

### Label

By default, the label of the chart will be the same as the name of the saved view.
You can override the label when displayed on the dashboard by setting the text here.

### Ignore Dashboard Filters

Check this box if you want this saved view to ignore
[dashboard filters](/dashboards/filters). When this is set, only the filters from the
saved view will be used.

### Legend

Change where the legend is placed. You can select "Inherit from Saved View" to match
legend placement with the saved view.

### Axis Labels

Change whether the axis of the chart are shown or hidden. You can select
"Inherit from Saved View" to match axis label with the saved view.

### Automatic Color Syncing

If multiple charts on the page define series over the same
[attribute](/data-modeling/Data-Models-Overview)
then the colors will automatically be synchronized. This ensures the colors are
consistent between all the charts on the dashboard.
