ClickHouse is an open-source column-oriented database management system (DBMS) optimized for online analytical processing (OLAP). It's designed to enable fast, real-time data analysis. ClickHouse achieves its speed and efficiency by employing column-based storage, vectorized query execution, and a range of other data processing optimizations.

You might want to use ClickHouse in scenarios that involve querying and processing large volumes of data. This could include analyzing logs, performing real-time analytical processing, processing time-series data, and running full-text searches, among other uses. It is often used in cases where real-time data analysis is critical.

If you have relatively small data or are very early, using something lightweight like Postgres or uploading csvs or parquet files to our DuckDB integration could also be good options.

### How to get set up

1. Set up a ClickHouse database, either by hosting it on your own infrastructure or signing up for [ClickHouse Cloud](https://clickhouse.com/).
2. Set up a username and password for usage by Glean.
3. In Glean, go to your [project settings](https://glean.io/app/p/settings#database_connections) page from the project dropdown and click `+ New Database Connection`.
4. Change the datatabse type to "ClickHouse" and fill out the connection settings as described below.
