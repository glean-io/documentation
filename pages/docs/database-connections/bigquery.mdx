# Google BigQuery (GCP)

BigQuery is a great cloud data warehouse to get started with: they have a
free tier, and it feels totally serverless: you don't have to worry about configuring instance or node sizes like you do with snowflake.

BigQuery is also good if you need to be HIPAA compliant and don't want to sign
onerous enterprise licenses (for US-based healthcare companies). In short, we
recommend using BigQuery if you have moderate amount of data to query and want
to set up a cloud data warehouse. We use BigQuery for Glean's own analytics.

If you have relatively small data and are very early, using something
lightweight like Postgres or uploading csvs or parquet files to our DuckDB
integration could also be good options.

### How to get set up:

1. [Sign up for free GCP / BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) account
   if you don't have one
2. Set up a Service User Account in Google Cloud
3. Set up a database connection in Glean

## Create a BigQuery service account

BigQuery connections in Glean use GCP service accounts to connect to your
database. You will need to copy and paste the entire contents of a service
account JSON key file into this field. See the
[Google documentation on authenticating with service accounts](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/authentication/service-account-file)

1. Create a service account in GCP by going to
   [IAM > service accounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts)
2. Select `+ Create Service Account` from the top of the page
3. When prompted you will need to add four IAM roles below

   - `BigQuery User`
   - `BigQuery Data Viewer`
   - `BigQuery Job User`
   - `BigQuery Metadata Viewer`

4. Once you've created the service account, click into the service account and
   select the `Keys` tab.
5. Click `Add Key` and make sure you create a JSON key (not a P12 key). The key
   will be automatically downloaded to your computer - you'll need to open the
   file and copy the contents so you can drop them into Glean below.

## Create BigQuery database connection in Glean

1. First, go to your
   [Glean settings](https://glean.io/app/p/settings#database_connections) page
   from the project dropdown
2. Click `+ New Database Connection` and fill out the fields below

### Settings

- **Connection name**: a name for this database connection. If you use DataOps,
  you can use the connection name to refer to this database.
- **Project name**: the GCP project. This is optional since it's usually also
  included in the below key file.
- **JSON key file**: the entire contents of the JSON key file for the service
  account needs to be copy and pasted into this field.

<Callout type="info">
  **"JSON key file"**- BigQuery service accounts use a JSON file as a
  credential. You will have to copy and paste the entire contents of this JSON
  file into the JSON key file field.
