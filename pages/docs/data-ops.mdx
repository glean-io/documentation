DataOps in Glean allows you to represent your resources as configuration files, which can be stored in a Git repository and deployed to your Glean project as part of a change management workflow.

Using DataOps, you can:

- ‚úÖ **Validate** planned changes to your data warehouse or Glean resources to ensure that your views and dashboards don't break
- üèóÔ∏è **Preview updates** to your Glean project before making them visible to the rest of your organization
- üë• Use **code reviews** or pull requests to collaborate on proposed changes
- üßë‚Äçüíª **Configure Glean** using the same tools that you use to develop your backend pipelines
- üö¶ Use a **continuous integration** system to deploy updates to your Glean project

DataOps is under active development and currently has some limitations, including:

- The Glean configuration files do not yet support every feature that is available in the Glean web application.
- If you build resources from a Git repository, users are still able to edit those resources through the Glean UI. When you re-deploy these resources with your DataOps configuration files, any changes made through the Glean UI will be overwritten.

## DataOps Basics

To use DataOps, you define one or more of your Glean resources using **configuration files**. A configuration file contains a complete specification of a resource. For instance, a Model configuration file contains information about which database connection to use, the name of the underlying database table, a list of attributes and metrics, etc.

Using a set of configuration files, you create a **Build**. There are two different kinds of Builds:

- A **Preview Build** validates your configuration files and, if successful, provides a URL that will show you what your Glean Project will look like if your pending changes are applied.
- A **Deploy Build** validates your configuration files and, if successful, publishes those changes to your Glean Project.

<Callout type="warning">
  We recommend always first creating a Preview Build to see which resources will
  be affected prior to running a Deploy. The build process will automatically
  delete and create resources in Glean to leave your project in a consistent
  state. For example, if you delete a column in a model configuration file, all
  saved views that refer to that column will be automatically deleted (as
  happens if you delete a column through the user interface). To use DataOps,
  save the [configuration](/docs/data-ops/managing-resources-with-code) of one
  or more of your resources to your local environment or a Git repository. Then,
  you can create a Build using the [Glean command-line interface
  (CLI)](/docs/data-ops/using-the-glean-cli), or through the Glean web
  application by connecting your account to a [Git
  repository](/docs/data-ops/git-integration).
