# Quick Start

Once you get access to Glean, you will be invited to login to a project. Users can belong to multiple projects, but data cannot be shared between projects. So users, permissions, database connections, data models and every other resource is isolated in the context of a project. Typically your entire organization can be managed in a single project.

<Callout type="info">
  **Not ready to connect to a database?**- You can use a [Sandbox demo
  project](/docs/project-management/demo-projects) to test the functionality of
  Glean with sample datasets.
</Callout>

## 1. Add a database connection

Also see [database connections](/docs/database-connections) for configurations specific to different database types.

<Callout type="warning">
  **Firewall Configuration**- If you use a firewall to restrict access to your
  database, you'll need to allowlist Glean's IPs. Glean will always connect to
  your database from one of these IP addresses.

```
18.210.29.198
34.230.230.9
```

</Callout>

1. [Go to the Settings page](https://glean.io/app/p/settings)
2. Click `+ New Database Connection`
3. Select the type of database; either Athena, BigQuery, Snowflake, Postgres, Redshift, ClickHouse or DuckDB
4. Enter the credentials according to your type of database
5. Click `Test` to test your connection
6. Click `Add` to complete the process

## 2. Define a data model

<div style={{ position: "relative", paddingBottom: "62.5%", height: 0 }}>
  <iframe
    src="https://www.loom.com/embed/16445a878e2d4e12af36241ce581345d?hide_owner=true&hide_share=true&hide_title=true&hideEmbedTopBar=true"
    frameBorder={0}
    webkitallowfullscreen="true"
    mozallowfullscreen="true"
    allowFullScreen={true}
    style={{
      position: "absolute",
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%"
    }}
  />
</div>

Every chart and analysis is based on a Glean data model.

1. [Go to your project homepage](https://glean.io/app/) and click `New Data Model`
   Select a database connection, click on a table name, and click `Build Model`

<Callout type="info">
  **Using a SQL Query**- Each Glean data model is based on an underlying data
  table. If the data in your data isn't quite in the right format, it's possible
  to specify an underlying query as the basis for your data model.
</Callout>

3. Define the data model
   a. Edit the name of the data model at the top of the page
   b. Add additional measures and attributes by clicking `Add measure` and `Add attribute` next to the name of the field
   c. Create a SQL based custom measure by clicking `Add custom measure` (see [Measures]() for more details)

4. Click `Save Model` then click `Open in Explore` to start exploring the data

## 3. Start interacting with your data

1. [Go to the Data Models page](https://glean.io/app/p/data-models)
2. Click on the name of the data model we just created

> You're ready to begin interacting with your data. Next, [learn how to use the
> Attribute Tray](/docs/visualizing-data/attribute-tray) to filter and breakout
> your data.
