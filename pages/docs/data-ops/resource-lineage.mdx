2. Select `DataOps` from the menu.
3. Go to `Resource Lineage` or follow the link: [Resource Lineage](https://glean.io/app/p/data-ops#resource_lineage).

### On a Per-Resource Basis

2. Click on the dropdown three dots button at the top of any resource page.
3. Select `Resource Lineage` from the dropdown menu.
