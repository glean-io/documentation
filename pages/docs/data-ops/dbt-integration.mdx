# dbt Integration

## Overview

Glean can import models directly from dbt. This is useful for incorporating Glean into existing DataOps workflows, allowing you to make changes to your dbt schema while identifying issues in downstream visualizations and dashboards.

You must add the following fields to the `meta` key of each dbt model you want imported to Glean:

```yaml
# schema.yml

version: 2

models:
  - # ... dbt model configuration 
    meta:
      glean:
        glean: "1.0" # Glean dbt integration version
        name: # Glean model name
        source:
          connectionName: # which Glean data connection to use
    columns:
      # ... your dbt columns
```

`source` has the same options as the corresponding field of [Glean data models](./config-schema/data-models.mdx). Unless otherwise specified, Glean automatically infers defaults for the source `physicalName` and `schema`. If no `connectionName` or `connectionId` is specified, Glean will try to use a connection whose name is the same as the dbt target database (e.g. `"bigquery"` or `"snowflake"`).

You can then use dbt to produce a [Manifest JSON file](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/artifacts/manifest-json), which can be included with any Glean DataOps build (or preview):

```bash
$ glean preview --dbt-manifest=./target/manifest.json
```

Glean will include each dbt column as an attribute in the corresponding Glean model. You can also add additional fields to the dbt columns to take advantage of Glean's more advanced modeling features:

```yaml
    # ... as above
    columns:
      - name: my_dbt_attribute
        documentation: this is a dbt attribute
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null
        # add additional configuration to this column
        meta:
          glean:
            primaryKey: true
```

To add Glean metrics (or other attributes not present in the dbt model) to the imported model, you can add a `cols` field to the dbt model's `meta.glean` configuration:

```yaml
models:
  - # ... dbt schema configuration, as above
    meta:
      glean:
        cols:
          - id: daily_active_users
            type: metric
            name: Daily Active Users
            sql: COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) / COUNT(DISTINCT create_at)
```

Glean configuration in your dbt schema file has access to the same [templating and macros](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/jinja-macros) as your dbt configuration. You could, for example, configure the Glean data connection based on your dbt target:

```yaml
models:
  - # ... dbt model configuration 
    meta:
      glean:
        glean: "1.0"
        name: "customers"
        source:
          # configure the source based on the dbt target
          connectionName: "{{ target.database }}"
```

Imported dbt models are exclusively controlled by DataOps and cannot be saved from the web UI, though you are still free to prototype and experiment with dbt models in the Glean model editor.

## Global configuration

If all models use the same Glean `source`, you can configure a default `source` in the `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yaml
# dbt_project.yml

models:
  the_models:
    +meta: # will be applied to every model in models/the_models
      gleanDefaultSource:
        connectionName: # which Glean data connection to use
```

To import all dbt models in a folder as Glean models, simply add

```yaml
# dbt_project.yml

models:
  the_models:
    +meta:
      gleanDefaultSource: # as above
      glean:
        glean: "1.0"
```

This configuration will add the `meta.glean` object to every model in `the_models`, so they will all be imported into Glean. You can still add additional metadata for the specific models (such as adding additional metrics).
