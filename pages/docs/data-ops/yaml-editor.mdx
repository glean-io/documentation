# Using the YAML Editor

The YAML Editor allows you to update resources through the app using [DataOps](/docs/data-ops) configs. The editor allows you to easily iterate on Glean resources as code and see changes in realtime. You can save your changes and explore via the application as usual while the YAML editor is enabled. Configs can also be copied directly from the editor into future data ops builds.

The YAML Editor is currently available in the Model Builder and in the Data
Explorer.

## Enabling the YAML Editor in the Model Builder

From the model builder, you can enable to YAML editor by clicking on the YAML
editor icon on the upper right corner of the center panel in the model builder.

can now make changes by directly updating the config file or by clicking through
the model builder interface as usual. Refer to the

your config files in the YAML editor.
