# Resource identifiers

## Glean Resource Names (GRNs)

A Glean Resource Name or GRN is a way to reference Glean resources in a stable way.
As a resource is changed, renamed, moved between collections, etc. its GRN will
always remain the same.

### Anatomy of a GRN

A GRN is comprised of three components: type, id, and alias, separated by `:`

```bash
type:id:alias
```

- `type` identifies the resource type

  - `dsb`: dashboard
  - `m`: model
  - `palette`: color palette
  - `sv`: saved exploration

- `id` is an globally unique identifier first assigned when the resource
  is created. The ID appears in the URL bar when viewing a resource.

- `alias` is an optional unique identifier set by the user in the resource's DataOps config.

Not all 3 components are necessary to specify a GRN. The `alias` can be omitted as long as an `id` is present:

```bash
type:id
```

and, likewise, the `id` can be omitted as long as an `alias` is specified (note the double `::`):

```bash
type::alias
```

The following are all valid GRNs:

```bash
sv:6yYdOIMG9hCAAHqB
m:RNuzTq-85qzAFKJ8
dsb:SV9nqwUHWmyk1zka

# some GRNs have longer IDs:
sv:a7905ae1-7f07-4c99-b9a5-930f409736a8
m:5948db01-0097-46fb-aec8-f68b1f09332d
dsb:658f8c83-c269-405c-ace6-677eece4c218
```

GRNs are case sensitive.

## Using GRNs

### Linking existing resources to DataOps

All resources can be specified with the special `grn` property to link a DataOps
config to an existing resource. This allows you to move a resource created in
the Glean web app into DataOps, without recreating it.

### Referencing other resources

Anywhere you specify a filepath in a DataOps config, you may instead specify a GRN.
This allows you to reference resources independently of how you structure your files.

### Referencing dbt models

When referencing models imported by the [dbt integration](./dbt-integration.mdx), the standard GRN format is valid. 
It is also possible to reference dbt models using the unique identifier of the dbt node representing the model:
```bash
dbt::dbtuniqueid
```

For example:

```bash
dbt::model.jaffle_shop.orders
```
