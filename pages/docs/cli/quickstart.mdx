# Quickstart

The Glean CLI lets you build your glean resources from configuration files, with [preview](./commands/preview) builds and [deployments](./commands/deploy).  Check out [example projects on github](https://github.com/glean-io/examples).


### Install the glean cli
First signup for an account by clicking 'get access' on [glean.io](https://glean.io).

```bash copy
pip install glean-cli
```

### Authenticate

The `token` command will take you through a web-based auth flow and download your access token to the default token location at ~/.glean/glean_access_key.json - you can also specify the token location with the environment variable `GLEAN_CREDENTIALS_FILEPATH`.

```
glean token
```

You can now test that things are working properly:
```
glean pull
```
