# Deploy

Deploy is a convenience function which works similarly to `glean build --deploy`.  The one other difference is that `deploy` will allow you to preview your build before deployment and show you what will change.

```bash filename="examples"
# this will run a preview first and ask if you really want to deploy:
glean deploy

# these two commands are identail
glean deploy --no-preview
glean build --deploy

# you can use deploy with all the same workfows as build:
glean deploy --dbt
glean deploy --git-revision=main
```
