# Preview

The preview command in Glean is a safe way to see what Glean configuration files will look like inside of Glean without affecting the state of the BI tool.  Pull makes forking and expirmenting with Glean from the command line cheap and easy.  A preview goes through the following steps:

1. Validate that local glean configuration files and dbt configuration (if using `--dbt`)
2. Validate that the data warehouse schema is in sync with your models and metrics
3. Create a copy of your main project and put it into a safe, containerized preview of your project
   a. provides you a link to this forked version of your project
4. Apply the configuration state fro your local file system
5. Provide you a list of all "managed" resources that are changed: either created, updated, deleted or unchanged

You can also generate a preview with `glean build`, so all the workfows: like git workflows, dbt workflows etc. that are available with the `build` command are also available in the `preview` command.
