## How to Send an E-mail Report

1. Go to the **Saved Exploration** or **Dashboard** you want to share.
2. Click the **Share** button on the top right.
3. Pick **Send as Email** from the dropdown.

When sending an email report:

- Specify a **Subject** of the report.
- Add the **Email Addresses** you want to send to. You can e-mail a report to up to 25 recipients.
- Write an optional **Message** if you want. This will be included in the body of the e-mail.

## Options

For **Saved Explorations**, you have a couple of extra options:

1. **Include chart image**: This puts a picture of the chart in the e-mail.
2. **Include underlying data**: This attaches the data as a `.csv` file. You can include up to 100,000 rows.

For **Dashboards**, the e-mail always includes a full-length image of the dashboard.

## Scheduling E-mail Reports

You can configure recurring e-mail reports to be generated on a schedule by selecting "Schedule recurring report" at the bottom of the "Share as Email" form and then clicking "Set Schedule".

On the next page, you can configure your report schedule:

1. Choose when you want the report sent:
   - Daily
   - Weekly
   - Monthly
2. Pick the time you want it sent (all times are in Eastern Time).

## What Happens When Reports Fail

If there's a problem and data doesn't load:

- The e-mail report won't be sent.
- An alert e-mail is sent to the person who set up the report, letting them know there was a problem.

## Managing Scheduled Reports

To check or change scheduled reports:

1. Click your **project name** at the top of the side menu.
2. Go to [**Scheduled Reports**](https://glean.io/app/p/scheduled-reports).

From there, you can edit or delete the reports you've scheduled.
