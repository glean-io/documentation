# Slack Integration

`Owners` can connect their Glean project to any Slack workspace. This lets users in your project
share saved explorations and dashboards directly to Slack channels with added notes and context. You can also schedule
automated reports to keep your team up to date with important metrics.

## Connect the integration

1. Go to [`Integrations`](https://glean.io/app/p/settings#integrations) section in the `Settings` page.
2. Under the `Slack` subsection, click `Add to Slack`.
3. Click `Allow` on the next page to authorize the Glean app for Slack to access your Slack workspace.
4. Click `Return to Settings` on the next page to return to Glean.

## Sharing to Slack

Once someone in your Glean project has connected the Slack integration, Glean users with appropriate permissions
can share saved explorations and dashboards to Slack. By default, this is restricted to `Collaborators`.

1. Open a saved exploration or dashboard in Glean.
2. Click the `Share` dropdown at the top right corner and select the `Share to Slack` option.
3. In the modal that opens, select the Slack channels you'd like to share to and optionally enter a comment with any context. Only public channels, and private channels to which you've specifically added the Glean app for Slack, will appear.
4. Click `Send` and your report will appear in Slack within the next minute or so.

## Interacting in Slack

When a Glean report is shared to Slack, it arrives with a few buttons prompting your team with next steps they can take:

1. **Open in Glean**: In a new browser tab, opens the Glean resource backing the report.
1. **Add Schedule**: In a new browser tab, opens a Glean modal for creating an automated schedule for the report.

1. Check `Schedule recurring report` at the bottom of the modal.
2. Click `Set Schedule` and enter the schedule's timing along with whether you'd like to skip sending reports that have no data.
3. Click `Schedule` to submit the schedule.
