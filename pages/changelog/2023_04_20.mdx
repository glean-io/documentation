Hello friends of Glean -

I hope this product update finds you well!

Our team continues to grow and we’ll be welcoming three more team members to our NYC office over the next month! The team has also been having a lot of fun with [SQL school](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7044007883801260032/), which is a way we practice what we preach - building a self-service data culture through teaching our non-technical team members SQL.

This month we’ve been focused on documentation and analytics features that will help bring Glean to life for your team. We have also been investing heavily in infrastructure and you’ll see the benefits in the next couple of updates from us!

## Transpose Tables!

We heard your feedback on this one! Transpose Tables are officially live in Glean 🎉 You can now switch the positions of your rows and metrics by toggling Transpose in the Control Panel.

We started small with this feature that allows you to essentially turn the table by 90 degrees. We’re hard at work on more flexible pivot table configurations where you’ll be able to set both multiple row and column attributes. Check out our [product roadmap](/product-roadmap/) to see what else we're planning on building!

## Resource Descriptions

Documentation is hard. We get it 😅

Good news for you is that the descriptions you’ve written now appear throughout Glean. Hovering on a resource name reveals a card with more information about a resource including when it was created and a description. Documentation just got easier too, you can quickly update the documentation right from this card!

## 🔒 Controlled by DataOps

You can now protect specific resources to only be editable with DataOps. Set this flag in the YAML to ensure your resource configurations always match the configurations that you’ve defined in your repo. Read all the details [here](/docs/data-ops/managing-resources-with-code/)

We also separated Deploys from Previews in DataOps, making it easier to find the builds that have applied changes to your project.
