Hello friends of Glean -

Over the last month we’ve been focused on making sharing insights and building beautiful charts as fast as possible for your team.

Our team also spent time doing a [“Maker Week”](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/carlos-glean_our-newest-engineer-is-hacking-something-activity-7065406931158323202-SBj5?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) - our version of an internal hackathon. This time is dedicated to hacking new, risky ideas and many end up shipping as new features!

Lastly, if you’re based in NYC I hope you can join me, the Glean team and folks in the data community at our office next month for a [happy hour](https://lu.ma/gleanhappyhour).

## Refreshed Control Panel

We’ve redesigned the controls for building advanced visualizations in Glean!

Not only did the panel get a fresh coat of paint, but all of the controls are now organized for more advanced chart options. You can easily reconfigure charts, add documentation and jump into the code editor all from one place.

## Dashboard Exploration Links

Have you ever filtered a dashboard and found an astonishing insight you wanted to quickly share with your team? Glean now automatically creates a [Dashboard Explore Link](https://docs.glean.io/docs/dashboards/Overview/#dashboard-explorations) every time you interact with a dashboard, making sharing a URL to your insight a breeze.

[Explore Links](https://docs.glean.io/docs/visualizing-data/Explorations/) now work the same across Dashboards, Saved Views and Data Models.

## Public Link Sharing

We heard your requests for this one! You can now create publicly-accessible links for Saved Views, Dashboards and Collections. Click the ‘share’ button on the top right of any resource and select “Share a Link”.

Share these with external stakeholders to show them your data in Glean. Public Links let you safely share specific cuts of your data and don’t allow recipients to view underlying data or change filters.

Collections are shared in [presentation mode](https://docs.glean.io/docs/project-management/collections/#presentation-view) as a slide deck.

PS - If you’re not quite ready to share Glean views publicly, you can choose to [embed](https://docs.glean.io/docs/sharing-data-externally/iframe-embedding/) authenticated Data Models, Saved Views and Dashboards in external applications.
