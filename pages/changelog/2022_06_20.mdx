Hello Beta Customers,

It’s been a minute since we’ve sent out an update! We’ve been busy building after our launch even while we’ve been onboarding lots of teams / new users. See what we’ve been up to:

## New Data Model Workbench

We’ve rebuilt our model builder from the ground up. Now, you can preview your data while writing SQL or customizing attributes and metrics.

## Reorder your attributes

You can now reorder the attributes in the Explorer! Just click-and-drag to bring the most important attributes to the beginning of the list.

## Undo-Redo

We’ve added undo-redo buttons in the Explorer to make it easier to test changes. The browser back button now takes you back to the previous page.
