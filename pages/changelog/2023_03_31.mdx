## Metric Tiles

We’ve added several enhancements to our dashboard Metric Tiles! You can now easily monitor key metrics with sparklines and comparisons. Your team can now get a comprehensive sense of how all of your metrics are performing at a glance.

You can also configure tiles to display the latest value instead of the total. For example, you can show yesterday’s user count instead of total user count. Read more in our [docs](/docs/dashboards/Metrics/).

## Dynamic Breakouts

Breakouts in Glean have always allowed you to pick a set of attributes to track. For example, you can breakout seven customers that are particularly important and track their product usage. Breakouts keep comparison sets manageable and charts looking good. This is a core Glean feature which we love!

With the addition of ⚡️ Dynamic Breakouts, you can now define criteria that adapts your breakout as your data changes. For example, you could always track the top 20 revenue customers, or you could track the six most recent cohort months.

Dynamic Breakouts allow you to always look at the most relevant data in an easy-to-digest way. Here’s an example in our [demo site](https://demo.glean.io/app/sv/c5120fe8-b0a0-36e3-bc56-a795c081722e?explore=j1uKGyVZR2RIcsnk): this retention curve will always look at the three most recent years in the data and group all the other years together.

## Deep Search for Metrics with CMD + K

In addition to searching the names of your resources, Glean search (always available with shortcut CMD+K) now surfaces the names of the metrics defined in your data models.

You can jump right into a new exploration with that metric already selected! Resource descriptions are also now searchable, making it easier to find what you're looking for when you can't remember a resource's name.
