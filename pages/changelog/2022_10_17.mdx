Hi Glean friends,

As autumn rolls in, we’ve been focusing on making it easy to share the insights you’ve found in Glean. At the same time, we’ve made some serious usability improvements to our data explorer and model builder.

A few highlights:

- **Explore links:** send someone your browser URL at any time to share your exploration
- **Explorer binning controls:** Adjust bin sizes on the fly
- **Change data source:** Point a data model at a new table
- **Table usability:** Resize and hide columns
- **MySQL support**

## Explore links

### Quickly share what you see

<div style={{ position: "relative", paddingBottom: "62.5%", height: 0 }}>
  <iframe
    src="https://www.loom.com/embed/5678330610894af6a67b304f364ba068?hide_owner=true&hide_share=true&hide_title=true&hideEmbedTopBar=true"
    style={{
      position: "absolute",
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%",
    }}
  ></iframe>
</div>

Exploring data is core to Glean and now it’s even easier to share what you’ve found. You can now get a link to your current exploration with a single click.

Whether it’s a key insight that will drive the business, a data quality issue you found by clicking into a filter, or a carefully crafted table of user retention - a link to your current exploration is just a click away.

## Don’t miss these other updates

- **MySQL support:** Glean added support for MySQL and other MySQL-compatible databases like MariaDB.
- **DataOps improvements:** We’ve expanded support for specifying visualization options in DataOps configuration files, including rich table formatting. We’ve also deployed an improved architecture to our backend, which will make it dramatically easier to keep DataOps support up to date as we introduce new visualization options in the future.
- **Legend titles:** a small improvement - you can now add a title to chart legends. Very helpful for boolean variables!
- **Foldable schemas in Model Workbench:** you probably have a lot of tables in your database and navigating through them in Glean was a bit tricky. We now support collapsing your tables under their respective schemas to keep things more organized. You can still search through all of your tables.
