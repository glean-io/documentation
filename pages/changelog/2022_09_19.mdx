We’ve been focusing on making Glean feel organized even as your company scales!

Finding the saved explorations and dashboards you're looking for just got a lot easier with collections right in the navigation and an improved search pane.

## New sidebar

### Keep your project organized

}

We put your collections right in the sidebar to make it easier to get to what you’re looking for and keep your project tidy.

You can now reorganize your content and make private resources shared right from the sidebar.

Get back to your most recent items quickly. The search palette starts with the last content you accessed and sorts results by most recently viewed.

## Rename Attributes

You can relabel any attribute to help your team understand a column's meaning and how it can be used.

## SSH Tunneling

Glean now supports SSH tunneling for more secure connections. You can use a bastion host in your private cloud to allow Glean to more securely connect to your database.
