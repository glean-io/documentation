Hello friends of Glean!

We hope that your year is off to a wonderful start and you’re getting settled into 2023! Our team is wrapping up January with feature releases that make it easier to connect data into Glean and share it with your teams.

**TLDR:**

- **CSVs Upload**
- **Slack Integration**
- **Public Demo Site Launched**
- **YAML Editor [beta]**

The time has come - you can now [upload a CSV](/docs/data-modeling/query-data-files/) file and query it in Glean like any other table using DuckDB! Write custom queries, joins and update the data. We also support JSON and Parquet files.

We launched a [public demo](https://demo.glean.io/) site to show off example use cases in Glean! Check out the current examples for retention and subscription businesses; we’ll be adding additional examples over time.

Advanced users can now directly edit models and saved explorations as code with our in-browser [YAML editor](/docs/data-ops/Using-the-YAML-Editor.md), now in beta. Iterate quickly on your DataOps configurations with real-time updating and built-in autocompletion.
