The time has come - you can now [upload a CSV](/docs/data-modeling/query-data-files/) file and query it in Glean like any other table using DuckDB! Write custom queries, joins and update the data. We also support JSON and Parquet files.

Advanced users can now directly edit models and saved views as code with our in-browser [YAML editor](/docs/data-ops/Using-the-YAML-Editor.md), now in beta. Iterate quickly on your DataOps configurations with real-time updating and built-in autocompletion.
